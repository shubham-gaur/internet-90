Internet of 90s

The Internet Is Dying
---------------------

The Internet has come a long way. Since evolving from 1990s and foundation led by ARPANET; The Internet has largely progressed. Most of the internet made up today is based on WWW, SFTP and SMTP. It’s common to associate the Internet with these terms since this is true for 99% (_exaggerated fact that is made up!_) of people. Also, I would like to revolve around these points since these protocols were the base of ideology of the Internet.

The interconnected network known as the Internet, gave a power of awareness around the world. It has given a lot in terms of free speech, free knowledge and mainly free thoughts. It allowed us not to be bound by any circumstance and remove barriers in our communication.

It was a freedom of Expression and sadly It was!

Downhill for Internet might be too much of a stretch; but for the people who has grown in the era of foundation of Internet, already see it dying. Free speech has already been controlled and the fact is internet had been developed to overcome the limitations of offline free speech. Every text and document has been ranked on the engagement. Is it appropriate to rank content solely based on popularity? Offline surveys, reports, and studies formed the backbone of the Internet. This digital world has to be the replica of better offline world.  But this concept has been totally manipulated.

Free knowledge! This is the area where the most attention has been paid in the last decade.  Providing knowledge and Monetising knowledge are two completely different things. There are many major platforms those provide tonnes of videos; but the fun fact is, if the knowledge that has single source of truth than it transforms to intelligence otherwise to a confusion. People are just confused at the end of the day.

The concept of free thought has both emerged and declined. Monetisation has ruined the free thoughts. Many people want to solve a problem by the means of internet, for e.g. FOOS community; but survival is almost not possible.

Why another blog?
-----------------

This blog is just to remind that what we are missing out or say, what we are not going to experience further in the coming future. I want the concept of internet to be alive and to ensure that I just want to build things that internet community can cherish. I know there is a fine line between (free speech & hate speech), (free thoughts & destructive thoughts) and (free knowledge & fake knowledge). Idea here is, instead of making things fast and streamlined, what if we make it slow and break it to fix it.

*   A decentralised communication engine that tracks speech based on context rather than views.
*   A de/centralised mailing engine where adverts can be sandboxed to add-on services they provide, rather than exploiting the mail chains.
*   An untracked space that allows organic evolution and experiences that are not preferentially customised.
*   A system where knowledge is not monetised but evaluated, verified and promoted by efficient nonprofit channels.

Advertising revenue has been the backbone of the current Internet. But there has been greater examples of internet i.e. _not so connected_. This broken internet has equally contributed to the society and get the important things done such as ad-hoc networks, distributed networking, DLAN, P2P. It has never been the front face of the internet since they slow down/ puts restrictions to the user. They do rely on adverts to an extent but this slow internet has never been that attractive to the adverts.

Closing Note
------------

The central idea is to revive a **SLOWER** Internet. Slow not because of infrastructure but because of checks and validations. Slow not because of speed of communications but the quality of thoughts that needs to be communicated. And also, Slow not because we can but we should to avoid the miscommunication in this era of Intercommunication.
